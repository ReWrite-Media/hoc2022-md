# Red 1 - Lights

## Step 1
The zombie chef needs some help getting to the right lights on top. Use your code to help them get to the right lights in the right order!

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the blocks on the left to move the NPC to the correct lights. The order that the lights are going off while the code isn't running should be the same order your code is in.
