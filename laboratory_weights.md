# Laboratory - Weights

## Step 1
You need the scale to reach exactly 10 weight. Maybe there is a sign around here to tell me how much each mob weighs? 

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Get the total weight to 10. A chicken is 1, a sheep is 4, and a cow is 5.



```ghost
    hoc22.summonWeightChicken(1)
    hoc22.summonWeightCow(1)
    hoc22.summonWeightSheep(1)
```
```template
    hoc22.summonWeightSheep(1)
    hoc22.summonWeightCow(1)
      
```
```package
minecraft-hoc22=github:ReWrite-Media/hoc22-ts#v0.2.75
