# Potion Room - Potion Mixing

## Step 1
This looks like I can make something! Maybe there is an ingredients list somewhere in this room that can help me?

#### ~ tutorialhint 
You'll need one ``||hoc22.Nether Wart||``, ``||hoc22.Phantom Membrane||``, and ``||hoc22.Fermented Spider Eye||``. Summon each one at a time and knock it into the correct hole in the correct order to create the potion.
